# Hi, I'm Yaroslav 👋

I'm a **Software Engineer** with a strong focus on **Frontend development**.

I mainly work with **React, Next.js, and TypeScript**, building modern web applications with an emphasis on performance, maintainability, and user experience.

## What I do
- Develop frontend applications using **React / Next.js (App Router)**
- Work with **SSR, SSG, ISR**
- Build reusable UI components and scalable frontend architecture
- Integrate APIs and backend services (including **Supabase**)
- Handle forms, validation, loading & error states
- Work with **CI/CD**, **Docker**, and deployment (**Vercel, VPS**)
- Explore practical **AI/ML** tooling for development — researching prompt engineering and efficient LLM usage to achieve better results with less time and resources, where it meaningfully improves the workflow

## My approach
I care not only about *making things work*, but about:
- clean, readable code
- predictable behavior
- thoughtful UX details
- long-term maintainability

I prefer simple, well-structured solutions over over-engineering.

## Tech stack
**Frontend:**  
React, Next.js, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, Tailwind

**Tools & Other:**  
Supabase, Docker, CI/CD, Git, Vercel

**AI (exploratory):**  
Prompt engineering, LLM tools for developer productivity and prototyping — with a pragmatic, cost- and time-efficient focus.

## A bit about me
I enjoy understanding how things work behind the scenes and continuously improving my development workflow.
Focused on building practical, well-reasoned solutions and refining my approach over time.
